# 1 Task in course - Matrix multiplication

## Usage
```
./a.out num-of-threads
```
Also threre are two defines - BENCH and TEST. BENCH - compute speed for different number of threads. TEST - check if parallel multiplication is correct.

## Next steps
We can work now on kernel - multi of one block. SSE/AVX, cycles unwrap and so on.
